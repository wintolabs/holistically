Homeopathy has often been misunderstood, and one of the most common myths is that homeopathic medicines contain steroids.  
Patients frequently come to clinics with this doubt, worrying that the small white pills might secretly include harmful ingredients.

Let’s break this myth and uncover the truth about homeopathy.

🔬 **Understanding Homeopathic Medicines**

Homeopathic medicines are:

1️⃣ Prepared from natural sources – 🌱 plants, ⛰️ minerals, and sometimes 🐝 animal-derived substances  
2️⃣ Processed through potentization – serial dilution and vigorous shaking (succussion) to enhance their healing effect  
3️⃣ Administered in tiny doses – to gently stimulate your body’s self-healing mechanism  
4️⃣ Carried on sugar globules – 🍬 the small white pills are just carriers; they do not contain chemicals or steroids

❓ **Why Do People Think Homeopathy Has Steroids?**

1️⃣ ⚡ Fast Relief in Some Conditions

2️⃣ 📚 Lack of Awareness  
Many people link steroids with rapid symptom suppression, not knowing homeopathy works by boosting immunity and restoring balance.

3️⃣ 🌐 Misinformation  
Fake or unregulated products online sometimes contain adulterants, which tarnishes the reputation of genuine homeopathy.
